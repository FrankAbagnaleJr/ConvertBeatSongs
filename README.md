# ConvertBeatSongs
This project is to convert Beat Saber songs from the old format to the new format automatically.

I think I did everything right that you can just download and run it and it will do what it's supposed to. You may have to enter your beatsaber directory if it's non-standard. Please let me know about any issues.

ConvertSongs.ps1 is the source code, that you can inspect and modify before running if you don't trust me. You do have to change your execution policy to do that, so I recommend using the executable.

ConvertSongs.exe is compiled using the https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5 and will run and convert the songs automatically (to the best of it's ability)

Thank you to LolPants with Songe-Converter as the backbone to this project. https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter/releases
